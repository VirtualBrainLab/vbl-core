# vbl-core
Virtual Brain Lab core libraries and assets

# submodule
This repository should be added to other repositories as a submodule by calling:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/dbirman/vbl-core Assets/vbl-core
```

In Github Desktop this will happen automatically when you clone a parent repository. In the Desktop app I recommend adding the vbl-core repository separately and changing it's name with an alias to `ParentRepo-vbl-core`
